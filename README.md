# ðŸŒ² Dynamic Sparse Table

Implementation of a **dynamic sparse table** based on a modified **trie structure**.  
This project was created as part of my **Algorithms and Data Structures** course at *GdaÅ„sk University of Technology*.

## ðŸ“– Description

To store values indexed by **sparse keys** from a universe *N*, common solutions like hash tables are often used.  
However, they may suffer from **poor worst-case access time**.  

An alternative is to use a **trie-based structure**, which guarantees better pessimistic time complexity.  

In this project, the trie is parameterized by two values:  
- **n** â€“ number of children in the root  
- **k** â€“ number of children for each next level  

## ðŸ”‘ Operations
- **Insertion** â€“ key `x` is placed starting from the root; if taken, we move to child nodes with indices `x mod n`, then `mod k`, until a free spot is found.  
- **Search** â€“ performed in the same way, following `mod n` / `mod k` path until the key is found or an empty node is reached.  
- **Deletion** â€“ requires finding node `p` with key `x`. If itâ€™s an internal node, a **leaf candidate `q`** is searched (always to the left in our strategy). Its value is copied into `p`, and node `q` is removed.
